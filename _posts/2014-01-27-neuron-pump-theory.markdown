When I learned about circuits, I often used the [Hydraulic analogy][ha] to reason with the problems. Batteries are pumps. Resistors are blocked up pipes. Capacitors are stretchy membranes. Inductors are massive fans. Since the metaphor is so graceful in that domain, I've decided to try and reason with neurons in the same way, keeping in mind that this is only a *model*, and not a true representation of how things work.

A neuron is like a little sac of water that siezes up (fires) under certain conditions. This produces a wave of water (action potential) rushing through the output pipe (axon). At the end of the pipe, it branches and forms many connections (synapses) with other neurons. The connections can vary in strength. Some will be clogged up and unresponsive. Others will transmit the flow freely.

The above is the basic overview. I've left (at least) two questions unanswered:

1. What causes a neuron to fire?
2. What changes the resposivness (synaptic plasticity) of connections between neurons?

I'll save those for later posts.
